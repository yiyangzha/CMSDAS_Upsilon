# Part 6 - Systematics

Uncertainties quantify the precision and reliability of a measurement. They are usually divided into statistical uncertainties, which arise from the finite size of the data sample, and systematic uncertainties, which come from sources such as detector effects, efficiency corrections, fitting choices, luminosity, or modeling assumptions. A complete result should report both types of uncertainties clearly.

The statistical uncertainties come directly from the RooFit yield fits performed in the previous part. In this section, we will evaluate systematic uncertainties.

## Sources
Every term in the cross-section expression can carry systematic uncertainty:

$$
\mathcal{B}\frac{d^2\sigma}{dp_\mathrm{T}\,dy}
\propto
\frac{N}{\mathcal{L}\,A\,\epsilon}
$$

This means uncertainty can come from:
- yield extraction ($N$),
- acceptance ($A$),
- efficiency ($\epsilon$),
- integrated luminosity ($\mathcal{L}$).

A common per-bin combination is
$\delta_{\mathrm{tot}}=\sqrt{\delta_{\mathrm{yield}}^2+\delta_A^2+\delta_{\epsilon}^2+\delta_{\mathrm{lumi}}^2}$.

**Note**: luminosity uncertainty is usually provided officially by the experiment's luminosity group.

## Example: Acceptance Systematics
Due to limited time, we will use acceptance systematics as the main hands-on example.
- acceptance depends strongly on kinematic thresholds near phase-space boundaries,
- threshold variations provide an intuitive and controlled way to probe modeling sensitivity.

Threshold-variation setup:
- nominal: $p_\mathrm{T}^{\mu,\min}=3.1$ GeV,
- down: $p_\mathrm{T}^{\mu,\min}=3.0$ GeV,
- up: $p_\mathrm{T}^{\mu,\min}=3.2$ GeV.

> #### **Task**
> 1. Copy and modify the acceptance program variants:
>    ```bash
>    cd /path/to/CMSDAS_Upsilon/acceptance
>    cp acceptance.C acceptance_pt3p0.C
>    cp acceptance.C acceptance_pt3p2.C
>    ```
> 2. In each variant, change both the threshold, function name (so that it has the same name as the file), and output file names to avoid overwriting nominal results.
>    Threshold line:
>    ```cpp
>    const double kMuonPtMin     = 3.1;
>    ```
> 3. Run nominal/down/up and produce three `.csv` files.
> 4. Write a program by yourself to compute the per-bin acceptance systematic uncertainty:
>
>    $\delta_A^{\mathrm{syst}}=\frac{\max\left(|A_{\mathrm{up}}-A_{\mathrm{nom}}|,|A_{\mathrm{down}}-A_{\mathrm{nom}}|\right)}{A_{\mathrm{nom}}}$.
> 5. Plot the acceptance systematic over $p_\mathrm{T}$ in each rapidity bin.


> #### **Question**
> 1. Which $(p_\mathrm{T},|y|)$ regions are expected to have the largest acceptance systematic, and why?
