# Part 5 - Efficiency

This part computes efficiency $\epsilon(p_\mathrm{T},|y|)$, the probability that events inside the fiducial region are reconstructed and pass analysis selections.

Why efficiency is needed:
- similar to acceptance, efficiency quantifies the probability that fiducial events survive the full analysis chain.
- the final selection also improves signal-to-background ratio, which stabilizes the mass fits and helps reduce statistical/fit uncertainty.

## Efficiency Definition

$\epsilon(p_\mathrm{T},|y|)=\frac{N^{\mathrm{sel}}_{\mathrm{reco}}(p_\mathrm{T},|y|)}{N^{\mathrm{fid}}_{\mathrm{gen}}(p_\mathrm{T},|y|)}$

- denominator: generated fiducial events,
- numerator: reconstructed events that pass final analysis requirements.

Physical interpretation of the numerator cuts:
- kinematic cuts ensure consistency with fiducial definitions,
- `trigger` models online selection survival,
- `vProb` and candidate/charge requirements model analysis-level quality and topology constraints.

## Efficiency Calculation
We used the `PYTHIA` tool to simulate a large number of $\Upsilon\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay events and their reconstruction process by the detector. This gave us a full-chain MC with generation, detector simulation, and particle reconstruction to model the real data-taking chain.

By applying the other selections after acceptance selection to these events and calculating the proportion of events that pass the filter relative to the total number of events, we can estimate the efficiency values.

In `mc_efficiency.C`, the core logic is:
```cpp
if (std::abs(gen_muonP_p4->Eta()) > kMuonAbsEtaMax) continue;
if (std::abs(gen_muonM_p4->Eta()) > kMuonAbsEtaMax) continue;
if (gen_muonP_p4->Pt() <= kMuonPtMin) continue;
if (gen_muonM_p4->Pt() <= kMuonPtMin) continue;
All[iY][iPt] += 1.0;
...
if (std::abs(muonP_p4->Eta()) > kMuonAbsEtaMax) continue;
if (std::abs(muonM_p4->Eta()) > kMuonAbsEtaMax) continue;
if (muonP_p4->Pt() <= kMuonPtMin) continue;
if (muonM_p4->Pt() <= kMuonPtMin) continue;
if (nonia != 1 || !trigger || charge != 0 || vProb <= 0.01) continue;
Passed[iY][iPt] += 1.0;
```

**Note: DO NOT MODIFY the `kInputRoot` path in `mc_efficiency.C`. The existing path can be accessed.**
```bash
cd /path/to/CMSDAS_Upsilon/efficiency/mc_efficiency
root -l mc_efficiency.C
```

> #### **Question**
> In low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ (high-$p_\mathrm{T}$) bins, which numerator requirement is most likely to dominate the efficiency loss (`trigger`, `vProb`, or acceptance selections), and why?
> #### **Task**
> Verify your assumption by modifying the program to calculate the efficiency of each selection separately.
